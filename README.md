Modifies the buildbar for better compatibility with the following mods: Legion, Second Wave, Section 17, Upgradable Turrets, Replication, Aurora Artillery, and Thorosman. Additionally, adds prototype support commanders to both MLA &amp; Legion which have the ability to build the other factions buildings/units.
